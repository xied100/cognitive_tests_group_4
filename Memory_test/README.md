# Introduction to the test
Three grids with different figures inside will appear. Each grid will appear for 20 seconds, following by five questions. Try best to memorise the position, color, shape of figures in the grid and answer questions.
The result will be dependent on the average time consumed and the accuracy.
To start the test, you need to click on the run cell icon - the triangle in the toolbar or from the menu under Run>Run All Cells. Then scroll down to the bottom of all of the code, and you can then take the test. Follow the instructions in the test and enjoy!
# How to find information you need?
1. File "memory_collection" is the version I used to collect the data. Not just age, gender, drink, accuracy, time. But also each answer to each question. However, it only works occasionally (the same code sometimes returns True and send to google successfully, sometimes returns False and cannot send to google), if all answers are included in the dictionary. Because, when cut off these answer information in the dictionary, it works fine (as you can see in the file "memory_ refined". So, if you want to access the collected data, please use the Google form URL in the "memory_collection", instead of "memory_refined", as they lead to two different google forms.
2. File "memory_refined" is the version I made it better for data coolection and better in user experience. Specifically, first we only allow users to enter upercase 4 letters as their ID and lowercase male/female as their gender. This helps data collecting and analysis. Second, At the end of the test, a dataframe is demonstrated to tell readers how they perform in the test.
3. The three images are the grids appearing in the test.
