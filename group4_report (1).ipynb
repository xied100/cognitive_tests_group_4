    "The approximate number system is an approach that estimates size of a group without using symbols or linguistics. It has been reported that ANS enables an individual to identify differences in size between groups of things from a young age. \n",

    "The ANS develops an array of skills, which goes beyond mathematics alone. (Mazzocco et al., 2011) was the first to demonstrate that early precision in Approximate Number System (ANS) measured at preschool predicts mathematics skills in primary school, independent of general IQ.  \n",

    "(Wulandari et al., 2021) mentions that in solving mathematical problems, pre-service mathematics teachers with strong number sense abilities also exhibit spatial reasoning skills. Additionally, their number sense abilities are reflected in their ability to make accurate calculation estimations, perform mental calculations flexibly. Thus, both spatial reasoning and number sense abilities play a crucial role in their approach to tackling mathematical challenges. \n",

    "Previous studies have demonstrated there is a difference between male and female when it comes to cognitive tests. In terms of spatial abilities, male perform better in three main tasks, including spatial perception, spatial visualisation and mental rotation (Weiss et al., 2003c). \n",

    "In addition, gender differences were studied in terms of mathematics performance. The study (Stoet & Geary, 2013) analyzed one decade of data collected by the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). In general, boys scored higher than girls in mathematics. \n",

    "Although male and female are different in physiology and psychology, memory is generally quite stable across the genders. In (Pauls, Petermann, & Lepach, 2013), from participants aged between 16 and 69, female performed on auditory memory tasks, while male were better at visual episodic and visual working memory tasks.  \n",

    "In our investigation, we will first examine whether ANS is related to maths, spatial reasoning or memory skills. Next, we will examine whether the difference is significant between scores of males and females across the four cognitive tests. \n",

    "Methodology Overview: \n",
    "\n",
    "Literature Review: Initiate with a detailed review of existing research in the field of ANS (Approximate Number System) and cognitive tests. This review will serve to establish foundational knowledge, identify gaps in current understanding, and reference significant prior work, particularly studies related to our hypotheses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematics Ability Test: \n",
    "\n",
    "Delivery: Conduct an online test comprising 20 progressively challenging questions within a total duration of 3 minutes and 30 seconds. \n",
    "\n",
    "Format: Display each question for 1.5 seconds to assess memory and mathematical ability under time constraints, simulating real-world conditions where quick thinking is essential. \n",
    "\n",
    "Standardization: Ensure all participants receive the same questions in the same sequence, guaranteeing uniformity of test conditions. Scores will be returned as percentages to facilitate quantitative analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consent for Data Use: Obtain informed consent from participants for the use of their test results in our study, adhering to ethical research standards. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additional Information Collection: Gather supplementary data on participants' current mathematics study amount, family influence on their mathematics ability, and coffee consumption prior to the test. This information will be used to enrich the analysis and account for potential confounding variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "Participant Sample: \n",
    "\n",
    "Primary Group: Target students enrolled in the “Coding for Bioscience Research” module. \n",
    "\n",
    "Extended Group: Expand the sample to include students from relevant but diverse disciplines, both within and outside the primary module. \n",
    "\n",
    "Diversity: Ensure a broad demographic representation, including different nationalities, geographical locations, educational backgrounds, as well as family members and friends, to enhance the generalizability of our findings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Potential Research Questions and Motivation: \n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis A (ANS and Other Cognitive Skills): \n",
    "\n",
    "Question: Is there a relationship between ANS ability and skills in mathematics, spatial reasoning, or memory? \n",
    "\n",
    "Motivation: This investigation aims to uncover how different cognitive abilities, including ANS, interrelate and contribute to mathematical proficiency. The findings can inform educational strategies and interventions, particularly in early learning settings, by highlighting the cognitive processes crucial for mathematical development. "
