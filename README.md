# Cognitive Test Code (Group 4)

This repository contains code developed to run cognitive tests written as part of the BIOS0030 course.

There are four tests to complete. These will test your number estimation, mathematical, memory and spatial reasoning skills.

You can find four tests in four different folders.
Double-click on the folder of the test you want to do, and you can see a list of files.

You need to double-click on the file named "xxx_test" with the orange notebook symbol at the front. Then you can do the tests.
